Hello! I'm Vitor Mitsuo, a developer passionate about building software that solves real problems. I specialize in programming, data analysis, and finance.

I’m currently working as an IT Engineering Analyst. Before that, I worked with Market Risk and Finance, combining technology with financial expertise.

I’m also passionate about Data & Analytics (D&A) and I’m studying with a strong focus on this area, aiming to leverage data to deliver more insights and efficiency to financial processes.

I created this blog to document my learning journey, share project breakdowns, and practice writing in multiple languages. Whether you're a recruiter exploring my portfolio or a fellow developer, I hope you find something useful here.

Outside of work, I enjoy studying languages, reading about finance, and building personal projects. I’m also a big fan of One Piece, so much so that my daughter is named Nami, in honor of the Straw Hat Pirates’ navigator.
